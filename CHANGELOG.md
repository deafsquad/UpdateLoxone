## [0.3.8] - 2025-06-01 04:03:09
### Changed
- Enhanced `README.md` with a more detailed explanation of the Miniserver update process, including:
    - Version checking against the target Loxone Config version.
    - Authentication handling.
    - Usage of the `-SkipCertificateCheck` parameter.
    - The `updatelevel` validation step on the Miniserver.
    - How the update is triggered via `/dev/sys/autoupdate`.
    - Polling and verification of the update status.
## [0.3.7] - 2025-06-01 03:48:28
### Changed
- Updated `README.md` to clarify that the `-SkipCertificateCheck` parameter is primarily for Miniserver connections and does not affect SSL/TLS validation for downloading Config/App installers.
    - Corrected the Mermaid diagram in `README.md` to remove the incorrect reference to `-SkipCertificateCheck` for the Loxone Config download step.
    - Updated the parameter description for `-SkipCertificateCheck` to accurately reflect its scope.
## [0.3.6] - 2025-05-30 20:38:41
### Fixed
- Resolved an issue in `UpdateLoxone.ps1` where the `Update Miniservers` step could fail with "Cannot bind argument to parameter 'ConfiguredUpdateChannel' because it is an empty string". The script now correctly defaults to the "Test" channel if the `-Channel` parameter is not provided or is an empty string, ensuring `Invoke-UpdateMiniserversInBulk` receives a valid channel.
## [0.3.5] - 2025-05-30 20:33:45
### Added
- Implemented an `updatelevel` check before attempting Miniserver updates.
    - The script now queries `/dev/cfg/updatelevel` on the Miniserver.
    - If the reported `updatelevel` (e.g., "Alpha", "Beta", "Release") does not match the configured update channel for the script (with "Test" channel mapping to "Alpha"), an error is raised.
    - The error message informs the user about the mismatch and provides a URI (e.g., `https://user:pass@ip/dev/cfg/updatelevel/$Channel`) to set the correct `updatelevel` on the Miniserver.
    - This check is performed in `LoxoneUtils.Miniserver.psm1` and integrated into the main update workflow.
### Fixed
- Corrected a typo in a log message within `Test-LoxoneMiniserverUpdateLevel` in `LoxoneUtils.Miniserver.psm1` (related to `$scheme:`) that caused a "Variable reference is not valid" error during script import/execution. The variable is now correctly referenced as `${scheme}`.

## [0.3.4] - 2025-05-30 18:48:00
### Fixed
- Corrected an issue in `Update-MS` within `LoxoneUtils.Miniserver.psm1` where a plain string password was passed to `Invoke-MSUpdate` instead of a `SecureString`, causing authentication failures on local machines. The password is now correctly converted to `SecureString`.
## [0.3.3] - 2025-05-30 04:48:00
### Changed
- `Get-ChangelogNotesForVersion` now reads the changelog file directly.
### Added
- This entry tests the direct file read approach within the function.
## [0.3.2] - 2025-05-30 04:46:40
### Added
- Testing parameter splatting for `Get-ChangelogNotesForVersion`.
## [0.3.1] - 2025-05-30 04:46:04
### Changed
- Release notes will now be passed to `gh release create` via `--notes-file` for robustness.
### Added
- This entry is to test the `--notes-file` approach.
## [0.3.0] - 2025-05-30 04:45:19
### Added
- Test for v0.3.0. This should finally work.
- More detailed debug logging for changelog parsing.
## [0.2.9] - 2025-05-30 04:44:11
### Added
- This is a test for version 0.2.9.
- Release notes should be correctly extracted from this section.
## [0.2.8] - 2025-05-30 04:42:22
### Added
- Final test: Release notes from this section, with Get-Content fix.
## [0.2.7] - 2025-05-30 04:41:16
### Added
- Placeholder for testing automated release v0.2.7 with full changelog notes.
## [0.2.6] - 2025-05-30 04:39:53
### Added
- Test: Release notes will be populated from this section.
## [0.2.5] - 2025-05-30 03:12:31
### Fixed
- Corrected authentication logic in `Invoke-MSUpdate` within `LoxoneUtils.Miniserver.psm1`:
    - Added `$UsernameForAuthHeader` and `$PasswordForAuthHeader` parameters to `Invoke-MSUpdate`.
    - `Update-MS` now passes the manually parsed (non-URL-decoded) username and password to `Invoke-MSUpdate`.
    - `Invoke-MSUpdate` now prioritizes these passed-in raw credentials to construct the `Basic Authorization` header for its `Invoke-WebRequest` calls (both for triggering the update and for polling). This resolves 401 errors when passwords contain special characters.
    - The original `$Credential` object (with potentially URL-decoded password) is only used as a fallback if raw credentials are not available.
- Fixed a syntax error in `Invoke-MSUpdate` caused by a duplicated `try` statement, which led to PowerShell parsing errors.
## [0.2.4] - 2025-05-30 03:07:24
### Fixed
- Comprehensively reworked the initial version check logic in the `Update-MS` function (`LoxoneUtils.Miniserver.psm1`) to correctly handle authentication with special characters in passwords, while preserving the HTTPS-first connection attempt for `http://` entries.
    - Manually parsed credentials (username and non-URL-decoded password) are now prioritized for constructing the `Basic Authorization` header for *all* authenticated `Invoke-WebRequest` calls (both initial HTTPS attempts and HTTP fallbacks).
    - The problematic `$credential` object (which uses a URL-decoded password from `[System.UriBuilder]`) is no longer used for Basic Authentication if manual credentials are available, thus preventing 401 errors.
    - For `http://` entries, an HTTPS connection is attempted first. If it fails, an HTTP fallback occurs. Both attempts use the manual `Authorization` header if credentials are provided.
    - For `https://` entries, a direct HTTPS connection is attempted, using the manual `Authorization` header if credentials are provided.
    - Ensured `-UseBasicParsing` is consistently applied for HTTP requests.
## [0.2.3] - 2025-05-30 03:06:46
### Fixed
- Corrected an issue in `publish_new_release.ps1` where the script would fail with a "property 'Count' cannot be found" error if `Get-ChildItem` returned no candidate manifest files or no archive files. Ensured that variables intended to hold collections are always initialized as arrays.
## [0.2.2] - 2025-05-30 02:53:00
### Fixed
- Refined `Get-MiniserverVersion` in `LoxoneUtils.Miniserver.psm1` to correctly handle Miniserver entries specifying `http://`. It now directly attempts an HTTP connection with manual Authorization headers and `-UseBasicParsing`, instead of first attempting an HTTPS call which could lead to "AllowUnencryptedAuthentication" errors if a `$credential` object was inadvertently used with an HTTP URI during the initial HTTPS probe.
## [0.2.1] - 2025-05-30 02:50:15
### Fixed
- In `Get-MiniserverVersion` within `LoxoneUtils.Miniserver.psm1`, explicitly set `$iwrParams.Credential = $null` during the HTTP fallback when a manual `Authorization` header is used. This is a further measure to prevent PowerShell from attempting to send credentials in a way that triggers the "AllowUnencryptedAuthentication" warning/error, even when a manual header is present.
## [0.2.0] - 2025-05-30 02:47:34
### Fixed
- Implemented manual parsing for username and password within `Get-MiniserverVersion` in `LoxoneUtils.Miniserver.psm1` when constructing the `Authorization` header for HTTP Basic Auth. This ensures the literal password string from the `MSEntry` is used, preventing `[System.UriBuilder]` from URL-decoding characters like `%` in the password, which was causing 401 errors.
- Ensured that the URI scheme is explicitly set to HTTP for the fallback attempt in `Get-MiniserverVersion`.
## [0.1.9] - 2025-05-30 02:14:30
### Fixed
- Correctly applied the addition of `-UseBasicParsing` to the HTTP fallback logic within the `Get-MiniserverVersion` function in `LoxoneUtils.Miniserver.psm1`. This was intended for v0.1.8 but was not included due to an error. This change aims to improve compatibility with Gen1 Miniservers that might be sensitive to `Invoke-WebRequest`'s default parsing, potentially resolving persistent 401 errors.
- Corrected syntax errors in `Get-MiniserverVersion` that were introduced during a previous modification attempt.
## [0.1.8] - 2025-05-30 02:05:54
### Fixed
- Added `-UseBasicParsing` to the HTTP fallback in `Get-MiniserverVersion` within `LoxoneUtils.Miniserver.psm1`. This is an attempt to improve compatibility with Gen1 Miniservers that might be sensitive to how `Invoke-WebRequest` handles responses without this parameter, potentially resolving persistent 401 errors.
## [0.1.7] - 2025-05-30 02:03:52
### Changed
- Modified `Get-MiniserverVersion` in `LoxoneUtils.Miniserver.psm1` to manually construct the `Authorization` header for HTTP fallback attempts. This aims to resolve 401 Unauthorized errors with Gen1 Miniservers by ensuring Basic Authentication is handled more explicitly, similar to direct `Invoke-WebRequest` tests that were successful with a manual header.
## [0.1.6] - 2025-05-30 02:00:02
### Changed
- Updated `publish_new_release.ps1` to auto-detect `PackageIdentifier` if not provided.
- Updated `publish_new_release.ps1` to include itself in the files staged for the release commit.
## [0.1.5] - 2025-05-30 01:58:21
### Changed
- Investigated 401 Unauthorized errors for Gen1 Miniservers during version checks.
- Added enhanced debug logging to `Get-MiniserverVersion` in `LoxoneUtils.Miniserver.psm1` to provide more detailed information on credential parsing and `Invoke-WebRequest` parameters for HTTP calls, aiding in diagnosing authentication issues.
## [0.1.4] - 2025-05-30 01:33:10
### Fixed
- Updated `publish_new_release.ps1` to ensure `UpdateLoxone.ps1` and the `LoxoneUtils` directory (including `LoxoneUtils.psd1` and `LoxoneUtils.psm1`) are staged and committed for releases. This ensures fixes for issues like the BurntToast dependency are correctly included in new versions.
## [0.1.3] - 2025-05-30 01:29:46
### Fixed
- Improved `BurntToast` dependency handling:
    - `BurntToast` is now explicitly imported into the session after installation or if found pre-existing, ensuring its availability for `LoxoneUtils`.
    - `BurntToast` was removed from `RequiredModules` in `LoxoneUtils.psd1` to allow the main script to manage its loading.
## [0.1.2] - 2025-05-30 01:23:22
### Fixed
- Ensured `BurntToast` module is installed if missing before attempting to import `LoxoneUtils`, resolving startup errors on new machines.
## [0.1.1] - 2025-05-30 01:11:16
### Changed
- Corrected CHANGELOG.md date placeholder update logic in publish script.
### Added
- This entry for testing the refined date update.

## [0.1.0] - YYYY-MM-DD_TIMESTAMP_PLACEHOLDER
### Added
- `-DryRun` parameter to simulate releases.
- `-WingetPkgsRepoPath` and `-SubmitToWinget` parameters to automate local winget-pkgs preparation (manifest copy, validate, local commit).
### Changed
